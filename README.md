## Introduction

Welcome to the Pemira 2023 Voting System project! This document serves as a guide for our team's development workflow.

## Project Description

**Pemira 2023** is a local organization's voting system. The project involves creating a website with four main pages, including success and error pages. The system aims to provide a seamless and secure voting experience for our users.

### Tools Used

- **ESLint:** A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX. It helps identify and fix common errors.
  
- **Prettier (AirBnB):** An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style.

- **Lint Staged:** A tool to run linters on pre-committed files. It helps catch issues before they are committed.

ESLint and Prettier will likely to throws some errors, and warnings when your code doesn't conform the guideline. Moreover, upon `git commit`, Husky will run several tests and try to fix any auto-fixable errors and warnings.

### Styling and Directory Structure
